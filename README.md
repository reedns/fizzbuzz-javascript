Fizzbuzz JS
===================

This is a solution to fizbuzz for javascript practice.  I solved it using a function that takes a starting number and an ending number as arguments to create number range.  The function uses a for loop to iterate through the each number in the range.  It console logs 'fizz' for numbers divisible by 3, 'buzz' for numbers divisible by 5 and 'fizbuzz' for numbers divisible by 3 and 5 and just console for all other numbers.
